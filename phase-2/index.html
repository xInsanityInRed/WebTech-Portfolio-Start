                <h2>Teacher + Student = dumb and dumber</h2>
                <p>This content is derived from APC Magazine, November 2007.</p>
                <p>
                We had no idea there were so many dumb IT trainers and students out there.
                </p>
                <p>The stories just keep coming in.</p>

                David Tune of Boambee, NSW, was reminded of a particularly clever pair of IT Diploma students who handed in a joint research assignment, complete with the required signed statement that it was all their original work.
                </p>
                <p>
                Tune recalls: "Upon reading the work for grading, I was incredibly impressed to find three pages of the document written in perfect technical German, particularly given that the students in question were none too articulate when I asked 'Sprechen sie Deutsch?'
                </p>
                <p>
                End result: assignment rejected, students counselled and more care taken when cutting and pasting to cover assignment work.

                <aside>
                    <p>Anyone attending an IT lecture should expect that the lecturer knows the subject. But IT lecturers are a funny lot.</p>

                <p>Jun Li, a programmer, recalls working in IT support at a school.</p>
                <p>"I was told to set up a projector in one of the meeting rooms for school staff, as there was a presentation. Having done that, I hooked the presentation laptop to the network and tried to help one of the speakers from the IT faculty update the laptop to IE7. I logged off and asked her to log on with her account to try IE7.</p>
                <p>'What is that?' she asked when the IE7 install process asked whether phishing should be turned on. After I explained it, she told me that she was about to present a talk on internet security."</p>

                <h2>TUTORING THE TUTOR</h2>
                <p>Neil Meyers, library assistant from Gilles Plains in SA, recalls an incident with a part-time computer lecturer a couple of years ago.</p>
                <p>"I work in a vocational education library, and, on night shift, library staff are the default computer technicians/troubleshooters. One night, this part-time lecturer came to the counter, stating that she'd managed to get a CD-ROM disc stuck in the drive. She also said she felt a bit foolish, because she was instructing a class in basic computing and was unable to solve the problem in front of a room full of students.</p>
                <p>So I wandered over to give her assistance, pushed the drive eject button, out popped the tray and... no disc to be seen.</p>
                <p>Before I was able to ask out the obvious question, she piped up, 'That's the CD drive? I thought it was the other one!', pointing to an old 5.25in floppy disc slot, which was there even though the drives themselves had long since been decommissioned.</p>
                <p>Someone from IT got out the disc the next day when they upended the machine and it fell out. Then, a week later, after I gave the lecturer her CD back, she was back within five minutes, saying, 'You won't believe it, I've done it again!'</p>
                <p>And this was their computing tutor? So there I am in front of her class, shaking the heck out of the machine. So much for teaching people to handle their computers with care!"</p>
